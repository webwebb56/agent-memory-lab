# EXP-0001 — Anchor/Index file

## Hypothesis
A tiny, stable **INDEX/anchor** (<= 30 lines) reduces time-to-retrieve and context spend without reducing recall quality.

## Intervention
Create/maintain `INDEX.md` with:
- identity + invariants pointers
- current focus
- active projects
- key files/locations

## Procedure
1. Baseline week: no INDEX file; log retrieval events.
2. Intervention week: use INDEX; log the same events.

## Metrics
- time-to-retrieve
- number of file reads
- subjective confidence

## Success criteria
>= 25% reduction in time-to-retrieve with no drop in recall success.

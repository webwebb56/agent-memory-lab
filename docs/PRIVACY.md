# Privacy & data handling

This repo is public.

## Do not commit
- personal chats/messages
- phone numbers, addresses
- API keys/tokens
- raw agent memory files from real usage

## Recommended pattern
- keep real data in `data/private/` (ignored)
- publish only synthetic or redacted examples in `data/example/`
- document procedures so experiments are reproducible without private data
